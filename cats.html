                        Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second 
                        most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, 
                        care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for 
                        the well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

                            It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) 
                            directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten's growth closely to make sure its growth rate 
                            is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to 
                            feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not 
                            gain weight appropriately include the following:

                        <p>
                            Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks 
                            after birth. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten 
                            food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating hard 
                            food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for 
                            kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending 
                            on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your 
                            veterinarian for recommendations.

                        <p>
                            This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their 
                            level of activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to leave food out for 
                            the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking 
                            throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

                            Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at 
                            this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing 
                            packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and <strong>not</strong> just 
                            a category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser-quality proteins.
